			"During my internship, I worked on an HRMS portal, focusing specifically on the Action module. The application was built primarily using React.js for the front-end and Redux for state management. My role involved developing and optimizing components within the Action module, ensuring smooth functionality and seamless integration with the overall system. By leveraging Redux, I effectively managed the application's state, enabling efficient data flow and improving performance across the portal.",

			"During my internship, I underwent intensive training in JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js, gaining a solid understanding of front-end and back-end development. After the training phase, I focused on front-end development, where I developed and refined an admin panel by designing components and integrating them with the back-end using Node.js and Express.js. This ensured seamless communication between client-side and server-side components for smooth data exchange and functionality.",
